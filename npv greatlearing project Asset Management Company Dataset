Answer the below questions -
1. Reading the Rounds2, companies.txt files.
2. How many unique companies are present in rounds2?
3. How many unique companies are present in the companies file?
4.Write the code to convert companies[‘permalink’] and Round2[‘company_permalink’] columns
to uppercase.
5. Are there any companies in the rounds2 file which are not present in companies.txt ?
6. Merge the two data frames so that all variables (columns) in the company's frame are added
to the rounds2 data frame. Name the merged frame master_dataframe. How many observations
are present in master_frame ?
7. Write the code to drop the redundant column ‘'company_permalink' from the
master_dataframe.
8. Write the code to find the percentage missing value (column-wise) in master_dataframe. Drop
unnecessary columns.
9. Create a pivot table to compare the mean and median values for ‘raised_amount_usd’ and
‘funding_round_type’ across different funding round categories..
10. Filter the master_dataframe on ‘raised_amount_usd’ such as ‘raised_amount_usd’ lie
between 4 Millions to 15 Millions.
11.Identify the top 9 countries in terms of highest investment in ‘venture’ fund type.
12. Create the ‘main_category’ column by extracting the main sector using the column
‘category_list’.
Hint - Use the Lambda function or string function.
13. Using the user defined function convert the ‘rasied_amount_used’ column into a categorical
column as followa) If the amount is less than 5 Millions then recode as TypeA.
b) If the amount is greater than 5 Millions and less than 7 Millions then recode as TypeB.
c) If the amount is greater than 7 Millions then recode as TypeC.
